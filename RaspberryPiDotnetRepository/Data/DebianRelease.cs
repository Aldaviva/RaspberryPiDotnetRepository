    /// <para>For example, when Trixie is released, Buster will be archived by Debian and won't get security updates, keeping its previous "oldoldstable" suite because it's read-only. Bullseye will be renamed from "oldstable" to "oldoldstable" at that time. However, in this repository, I see no reason to delete existing packages for archived Debian versions, because people might still use them and it's no skin off my nose to keep building .NET packages for them (it's 100% automated and costs almost nothing). Therefore, this repository will continue releasing .NET packages for Buster even after Debian archives it, and I will call the suite "oldoldoldstable" at that time.</para>
